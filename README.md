# Air BNB Boston and Seatle - What Key BnB Features Most Influence Price and Ratings? 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Data Science techniquest to analysethe Seatle and Bostong Air BNB listing. It focuses on understanding the key features that mostly influence the BNB ratings and price.<br> It follows the CRISP-DM methodology: business understanding <=> data understanding <=> data preparation <=> modeling <=>  evaluation (deployment would be left for systematic usage).

## 1.	Installations
The following components are needed to run this Jupyter Notebook:
- Python version 3.9 + with Jupyter Notebook installed
- Key python modules needed, if possible install the latest release: numpy, pandas, sklearn, NLTK, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- After installing NLTK, ensure you run the python command nltk.download() to download all NLTK data packages. 

## 2.	Project Motivation
As part of my Udacity Data Science Nano Degree, I wanted leverage and ground my key learnings with a practical data science case. The Jupyter Notebook covers the key CRISP-DM process with practical code to load data, analyse the key features, see their correlations, leverage Matplotlib and SeaBorn modules to provide powerful visual insights, prepare the data, taking care of the missing value, romoving noisy columns, reformating string to be read as numeric, prepare the prediction models with the data splitting into test/train sets, run the models and analyse the results. It especially focus on visualizing the key factors influencing the BNB price and rating.
